This is intended to be a graduation project mainly, and a perfect real world learning experience

For now I won't accept any pull request(After graduation YES :D) from anyone since I need to be honest and 100% self-effort about this project, but feel free to fork the project.
I'm open for ideas surely to make the app better and enhance it's performance and stability :)
